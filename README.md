# mxcomp

Mxcomp is a base library that both stencet and rikiktiki use for general utility functions. The repo for this library is subrepoed from the libraries that use it, so you shouldnâ€™t have to explicitly grab it unless you want to reuse it.

It includes:

*   [Tuple extensions](http://www.metaxcompile.com/blog/2013/03/16/Working_with_tuples.html)
*   [Reflection](http://www.metaxcompile.com/blog/2013/03/14/reflection_in_c%2B%2B11.html)
*   Lightweight logger
